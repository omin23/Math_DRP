# Epidemiology Simluation (MATH DRP)

This project is used to simulate the spread of variaus diseaes using some of the bespoke mathematical meathods explored during the Math Directied Reading Program at Umich. 

### This project makes use of few core concepts:
* Ordinary Dfferencial Equations 
* Graph theory
* Markov Chains 
* Stochastic processes 

### How this model works: 
To simualte the spread of diseases among different communities,we represent each city in out specified location as a node. This way we can use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered ([SIR](https://stockton.edu/sciences-math/ezine/fall2021/mathematical-models.html#:~:text=William%20O.,%2C%20creating%20an%20SIR%20model)) to simulate the "current" condition of the city and use the edges between cities to allow the GNN to simulate the interplay between local disease spread and movement across the cities.
